Basic CSS & HTML
---

In this assignment, you are given an HTML file and a linked, but blank, CSS file. Following the instruction below, you are to style the page with CSS and consider possible changes to the semantic structure of the provided HTML.

An example image of the layout is provided as a reference.

### Tasks
Your task is to implement a responsive "holy grail" website layout using CSS. This consists of a header, footer, left & right side bars, and a center column. You will also style a "button" in the center of the page and some text related to it. We'll revisit this in the next assignment, when we add behavior to the page with JavaScript.

The header and footer should sandwich the rest of the page. Vertically, the header and footer should take up 1/15th of the available viewport, each. The header should have a pink background, and the footer should have a grey background. Both should have centered text.

The space between the header and footer should contain the side bars and center column. The center column should be 960px wide, and the left and right side bars should fill the remaining horizontal space evenly on either side. The left, center, and right elements should have red, green, and blue background colors, respectively.

The center column should contain a centered circular button with a white background and centered text. It should be 150 px in diameter.

All text should be colored black with 87% opacity.

**Important**: The layout you implement must be _responsive_, which means that as the browser is resized, all proportionate elements of the layout should scale smoothly. Elements with an absolute size should not scale, but should scale any proportionate positioning, such as centering, within a proportionate element, e.g., if the center of the containing element moves, the centered element should move with it. There should be no unspecified gaps between around the edge of the screen or between layout elements on the page.
